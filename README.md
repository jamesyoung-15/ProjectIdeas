## Web/Application Development

### Web Development
#### 1. Portfolio Website (Front-End Only)
##### Description
A basic portfolio website to practice basic front-end. I am thinking of making a little robot that greets the user using Blender and either putting it as a background video or use ThreeJS.

##### Tech Stack: 
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Others: Blender (Create little robot)

##### Priority Stack: Very High

##### Progress: Under development 

#### 2. IoT Sensor Dashboard (Full-Stack)
##### Description
A sensor dashboard that shows my home sensors. 


##### Tech Stack:
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend: AWS DynamoDB
- API: AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda
- Hosting: Nginx, Linux
- Others: ESP32 (Micro-controller), SGP30 (sensor), DHT11 (sensor)

##### Priority
High

##### Progress
Completed

##### Showcase

### Mobile Apps



## Networking/System Admin

### HomeLab



## Embedded Systems




## Robotics
Compared to the Embedded Systems projects, these will try to use ROS and will have a SBC or PC rather than a single micro-controller.
