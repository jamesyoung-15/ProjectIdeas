## Web/Application Development

### Web Development
#### Portfolio Website (Front-End Only)
A basic portfolio website to practice basic front-end. I am thinking of making a little robot that greets the user using Blender and either putting it as a background video or use ThreeJS.

Priority Stack: Very High

Progress: Under development 

#### IoT Sensor Dashboard (Full-Stack)
A sensor dashboard that shows my home sensors. 


Tech Stack:
