# Web/Application Development

## Web Development
### 1. Portfolio Website (Front-End Only)
#### Level/Complexity
Beginner

#### Description
A basic portfolio website to practice basic front-end. I am thinking of making a little robot that greets the user using Blender and either putting it as a background video or use ThreeJS.

#### Tech Stack: 
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Others: Blender (Create little robot)

#### My Notes
- Priority: Very High
- Progress: Under development 
- Showcase: 

#### Resources


### 2. IoT Sensor Dashboard (Full-Stack)
#### Level/Complexity
Easy

#### Description
A sensor dashboard that shows my home sensors. 


#### Tech Stack
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend: AWS DynamoDB
- API: AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda
- Hosting: Nginx, Linux
- Others: ESP32 (Micro-controller), SGP30 (sensor), DHT11 (sensor)

#### My Notes
- Priority: High
- Progress: Completed
- Showcase: Demo [here](https://airqualitydashboard.jyylab.com) and repo [here](https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/IoT-Home-Sensor-Dashboard).


### 3. Inventory Management
#### Level/Complexity
Easy/Medium

#### Description
An inventory management system that keeps track of my stuff at home. Will try to use PERN stack.

#### Tech Stack
- Front-End: ReactJS, CSS
- Backend: PostgreSQL
- Others: NodeJS, ExpressJS

#### My Notes
- Priority: Medium
- Progress: Not Started

### 4. Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four (Bot and Multiplayer)
#### Level/Complexity
Medium/High

#### Description
Idea is to create a website that allows users to play ultimate tic tac toe or connect-4 either against a friend or a bot. The bot will either use mini-max algorithm or a search tree. Multiplayer will use SocketIO. Added complexity will be if storing scores, user authentication, etc.

#### Tech Stack
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend: Depends
- Other: SocketIO

#### My Notes
Priority: Medium
Progress: Not Started

### 5. Blog Site
#### Level/Complexity
Easy

#### Description
Full stack blog website. Doing this as I do want to blog my learning experiences in certain projects mainly for myself and would be fun to create own blog website.

#### Tech Stack
TBD

#### My Notes
Priority: High
Progress: Not Started

### 5. Other Related Project Ideas
- Admin Dashboard

## Mobile Apps

### Moving Service Application
#### Level/Complexity
Easy to Extremely Hard. 

### Description
Idea is to create a similar app to task rabbit (full stack) with both Android and IOS support.

### Tech Stack
TBD

### My Notes
Priority: Low
Progress: Not Started

### Other Ideas
- Deploy Godo game to mobile
- 

# Networking/System Admin

## HomeLab
Idea is to self-host as many applications/content as possible, replacing things like Google Drive with Nextcloud, consuming media/music with Jellyfin, using own Proxmox server to host applications instead of using VPS, etc. See current [homelab](https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/homeserver/).

## Cloud
Still brainstorming projects that are more cloud focused, but most likely lean towards learning AWS services. Alongside projects may consider getting AWS certicates.

## Linux Admin
Consider getting Red Hat certificates

## Devops
Still brainstorming, focus on CI/CD w/ Docker and other tools.

# Embedded Systems
## Quick Ideas
- IoT Systems
    - Retrieve and send sensor data with different protocols (eg. MQTT, HTTP, LoraWan, etc.)
- Build robots (autonomous or remote controlled) with different micro-controllers (STM32, ESP32, etc.)
- Create game controller


# Robotics
Compared to the Embedded Systems projects, these will try to use ROS and will have a SBC or PC rather than a single micro-controller.

## Quick Ideas
- Autonomous robot w/ SLAM
- Computer vision tasks with robot (eg. pick up item, detect objects, etc.)


# AI/Machine Learning
Projects more focused on AI/Machine learning

## Quick Ideas
- Deep reinforcement learning in games (eg. Deep Q-Learning to play video-games)
- Image classification with CNNs
- NLP
- Kaggle Learning Resources (eg. Beginner Competitions)
- Implement another machine learning model to existing research

# Other Fun Projects
Other miscellanous projects that I may work on if I feel like it.
## Game Dev
- 2D pixel top-down shooter similar to Enter the Gungeon
    - Idea is to learn to draw pixel art, animate the spirtes, use Godot to build game

## Arts
- Create 3D models with Blender (could also use them for games)
- Create 2D pixel art using Libresprite (for my game)

## Photo/Video Creation and Editing
-  Would like to create Youtube videos (education/tutorials), only need really simple editing, will learn and use Kdenlive (only very basics tho)
- Would like to learn very simple photo editing w/ GIMP
- Maybe learn a bit of digital drawing/painting w/ Krita

# Open Source Contribution
Although I would like to contribute to open source, I feel like my current level isn't good enough to make any meaningful contribution. Later on hopefully I be smart enough to help. There are many projects I wouldn't mind helping, such as Jellyfin, Armbian, or other projects listed [here](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners).
